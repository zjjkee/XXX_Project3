We tested following functions as described: 

ComputeLSShortestPath: tested with disconnected networks, isolated network and some regular networks
extractPacketData : tested for boundary values
createPacket: tested for different types of packets (DATA , DV , LS )
updateLink: checked for new links , links with changed delays
sendPing: Checked with given test files (simpletest1 and simpletest2)
updatePortInfo: checked for dead links and links with changed delays
updateLS: checked for updated and unchanged link values. When at least one link is updated then the shortest path will be computed again.
updateDV: checked for updated and unchanged table values. Updates table for changed entries and sends changed values to all other nodes.
sendLSTable: check for size of table, check for avoiding sending dead links
sendDVTable: check for size of table, check for avoiding sending unreachable destinations.

Behavioural Tests:

Memory:
Tested with valgrind to check for memory leaks.

The test files included in this submission:
test1 - Tests network dynamics in a network with a central node 
test2 - Tests network dynamics in a linear network
